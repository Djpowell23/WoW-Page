# WoW-Page
Side Project: Creating a Webpage for updates for a potential WoW guild.

### Minimum Viable Product
Create a homepage for users to sign-in/register an account to use on the forums. The homepage will show Guild Updates, Events, and Announcements. In the taskbar will be a link to the forums page (Sign-in may have to occur on sign-in page. TBD).

### Major Processes
  * Create a database for User Information in order to have sign-in capabilities
  * Create a forum layout and determine best functionality in relation to user identity.
  * Find way to host on public server. Github.io?
